Requirement ID,Description,User Story,Expected Behavior / Outcome
REQ-01,Display a list of previously added ePub books on the main (library) screen.,"As a reader, I want to see my library of ePub books on the home screen, so I can quickly pick which book to read.","A list of all imported ePub books is shown on the library page, including metadata such as cover image, title, author, and page count."
REQ-02,Add/import new ePub books into the library.,"As a reader, I want to import an ePub book into the app, so it appears in my library with all relevant book details.","When a user imports an ePub file, metadata (title, author, pages, cover) is extracted and the book is added to the library."
REQ-03,Search for books within the existing library.,"As a reader, I want to search my library for a specific book, so I can find it quickly without scrolling through the entire collection.","A search bar filters results in real time based on the user’s input (title, author, etc.) and displays matching books."
REQ-04,Open and read a selected ePub book.,"As a reader, I want to read an ePub in the app’s reader mode, so I can navigate through pages easily on my device.","Tapping a book opens it in reading mode, allowing page navigation, text rendering, and displaying relevant book content."
REQ-05,Display a progress bar during reading to indicate how far the user has read.,"As a reader, I want to see my current reading position, so I know how much of the book remains.","A progress indicator updates in real-time as the user navigates pages, showing current reading progress in the ePub."
REQ-06,Save reading progress in AsyncStorage.,"As a reader, I want my place in the book to be saved automatically, so I can resume reading where I left off.","Each time a user advances pages, the current position is written to AsyncStorage. When the user reopens the book, reading resumes at that spot."
REQ-07,Display saved progress on the library screen.,"As a reader, I want to see my reading progress in the library for each book, so I can decide which one to continue reading.","Each book in the library shows a small indicator (e.g., a percentage or status) of how far the user has progressed in that ePub."
REQ-08,Automatic page switcher with custom time interval.,"As a reader, I want the app to auto-switch pages during reading, with a custom interval, so I can read hands-free.","Reader screen offers toggle for auto-page-switching and a slider/input to set interval in milliseconds. Pages change automatically."
REQ-09,Font size, style, line height and theme customization.,"As a reader, I want to change font size and style, line height, and use dark mode, so reading is comfortable for my eyes.","Reader settings menu lets users choose font, size, spacing, and toggle dark/light mode. Preferences are saved and applied instantly."
REQ-10,Table of contents navigation.,"As a reader, I want to see the chapter list and jump to any chapter directly, so I can navigate easily.","TOC is parsed from the ePub file and rendered in a side panel or modal. Tapping a chapter jumps to the correct page."
REQ-11,Bookmark pages with optional notes.,"As a reader, I want to bookmark pages and add notes, so I can return to important parts later.","User can tap a bookmark icon while reading, optionally enter a note, and later view/manage all bookmarks per book."
REQ-12,Highlight text and add notes.,"As a reader, I want to highlight text and attach notes to it, so I can remember important passages.","User selects text and can highlight it in color and add a note. Highlights/notes are stored locally and shown on revisit."
REQ-13,Search inside the current book.,"As a reader, I want to search for specific words or phrases inside the book, so I can find content quickly.","A search bar allows querying the book’s content. All matched instances are shown with context. Tapping a result navigates to it."
